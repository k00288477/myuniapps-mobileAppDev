# MyUniApps - Clubs & Societies
## Mobile Applications Development year 3

MyUni â€“ Clubs & Societies is a one stop shop for information and updates to events organised and ran by clubs and societies from the Technological University of the Shannon: Midwest. 
Students can view a list of clubs and societies within TUS that they are eligible to join. Access detailed information related to each club including a chairperson, the clubs email address, the meeting time for their next planned activity and a google maps location-based service so they can find their way. 
Students can create a profile on the application to save their favourite clubs to be viewed from the profile screen. Students will receive a notification reminding them about events from clubs that they have favourited on the app. 
Clubs can be registered with the admin of the application. These are clubs approved by the TUS University to prevent an oversaturation of clubs being created on the application. 
Club admin accounts can create new events that will be displayed to users. The details of these events can also be updated and deleted.
